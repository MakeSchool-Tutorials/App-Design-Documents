Now that you have some practice, let's write a App Design Document for your own tutorial apps!

> [action]
> Log into [GitHub](http://github.com) and create a new repository for your own app. You can use a previous repository if you've gotten started already!
>
> When viewing the new repository, there will be a link in the top bar that says "Wiki". Click on that and create a new page titled "App Design Document"

> Copy and paste this into the new page:

You've been through the motions already. Time to get it done for you own app! The steps below are the same as you went through on the previous page. They are listed for reference -- make sure to go through them all!

# App Design

## Objective

Explain your app in 2-3 sentences.

## Audience

This is where you explain what kind of people your app is targeting. What age range, interests, background, etc... characterize the users you expect? How much time and disposable income does this audience have? In what circumstances during the day will they use your app?

## Experience

Start by describing, almost like you are telling a story, how a typical user will interact with your app. Why will they choose to open it, what will they do when it is open, what is the benefit or outcome of using it, and what should they feel when using it?

Next list apps you think have a similar look and feel to what you want for your app. Refer back to them for inspiration on how to make interacting with your app consistent and rewarding.

# Technical

## Screens

Describe each screen in your app and how you get from one to the other. Are there any screens you could remove from your MVP?

As you paper prototype your app and progress through iterations, be sure to add pictures and screenshots here!

## External Services

What APIs or external services will you use when making your app? List them and any alternatives you may need to check out here.

## Views, View Controllers, and other Classes

List all Views, View Controllers, and other Swift classes you will need to make you app. Describe the flow through them and purpose of each

## Data models

List all Firebase data models your app will require.

# Minimum Viable Product Milestones

This is the section that should get updated the most often. You will be keeping track of what tasks you plan on completing each week. If you're new to projects this long, you will have to make best guesses as to how long things will take.

Before ordering your tasks on a week by week basis, first list every task on your plate. This should include everything you've listed in your app design document that will be in your MVP and all the non-technical work your app requires.

For every task, estimate how many days it will take. If you think it will take less than a day, round up to a day.

Add all the days together. Multiply by 1.2 to give yourself buffer time for unexpected delays. If you end up with more than 25 days of estimated tasks, do not change your estimates. Unless you have significant experience with large projects you should almost never change your estimates to be more optimistic. It is a big red flag if your gut tells you a task will take N days but after thinking about it you decide it won't take as long. You're almost always wrong.

If you have more than 25 days of work left, cut features. If it doesn't hurt, you aren't cutting enough features.

Revise your design document if necessary if you end up making significant changes to your app's design.

Only once you have a list of tasks that fit in 25 days should you start dividing them up week by week.

# Wrapping Up

Read your design document over to make sure everything makes sense. Check dependencies -- tasks should be in order of completion! Edit as necessary.

Always keep this up to date. You should be referencing it daily and updating it at least twice a week.
